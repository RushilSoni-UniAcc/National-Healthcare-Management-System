# National-Healthcare-Management-System

The National Healthcare Management System (NHMS), a centralized, 
relational database management system. It captures the core entities of the Indian healthcare 
system: patients, doctors, hospitals, diseases, insurance companies, and the government. Each entity 
is modelled as a table, with relationships connecting them in meaningful ways. 
The system tracks hospital affiliations, doctor specializations, prescriptions, chronic diseases, and 
insurance coverage. It also includes government support for specific diseases. Through stored 
procedures and powerful SQL queries, NHMS can generate bills, retrieve medical histories, track 
disease trends, and evaluate insurance eligibility. 
With NHMS, we aim to provide a robust and flexible foundation for better healthcare management 
across the country, making data more accessible, improving coordination between institutions, and 
supporting smarter healthcare decisions for all.
